# Database-CS186
## What is this?
The Introduction to Database Systems course at UC Berkeley has some projects that need to be completed, and this is my code implementation of the project in this course. The home page of this course is [here](https://cs186berkeley.net/sp21/), where you can find course resources such as videos, slides, etc. Cause my poor coding ability, several challenging problems are handled by referring to the [PKUFlyingPig's](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS186-Rookiedb) implementation.
